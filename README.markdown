**LNX2** is an low-overhead session layer extension of UDP protocol to provide optional retransmission and ordering. 

Multiplexing up to 256 logical channels, of which each can have different reliability/retransmission settings, it comes handly for specialized tasks requiring very low latency and avoiding adding TCP in the mix.

It is currently implemented for Python and Java.
